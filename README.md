# U.S. Agency for International Development INVEST PowerBI Dashboard

## Background
INVEST was global project implemented over seven years (2017-2024) that helped the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mobilize private capital for development results. Increasingly, private investors and businesses are looking to emerging markets for better returns and new market opportunities. INVEST was designed to unlock the power of private capital to drive inclusive growth in countries where USAID works. INVEST mobilized $1.61 billion dollars to help USAID Missions reach their goals for food security, gender equality, job creation, global health, climate resilience, and more.

## Project Purpose
This Power BI dashboard for USAID INVEST provided real-time visualization of key performance indicators crucial for project oversight, strategic decision-making, and reporting. This interactive tool synthesized complex data from an AirTable database, offering instant insights into capital mobilization, investor profiles, investment sectors, procurement activities, and learning events, thereby enhancing data-driven management and stakeholder reporting.
